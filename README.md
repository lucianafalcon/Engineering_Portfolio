## 1. MOSFET Memory Cell Programming

<small><font color="gray">The programming of a memory cell based on a MOSFET transistor consists of charging the floating gate with electrons, which occurs exclusively through Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from the conduction band of the substrate.

In the File, you will find how to carry out this process, which includes:

- Simulating the temporal evolution of the current injected into the floating gate and the threshold voltage for a control gate voltage of VG = 11V, determining the maximum achievable value of Vt.
- Analyzing the changes in the results when VG = 12V and VG = 13V.
- Exploring strategies to achieve a constant current injection process and simulating the response for VG = 11V.</font></small>
