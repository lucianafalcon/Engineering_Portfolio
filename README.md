## 1. Communication Network Fundamentals - Vol 1 

This document is a comprehensive technical summary covering key concepts in computer networks. It introduces the structure and function of communication systems, including physical components, protocols, performance metrics, and communication models like OSI and TCP/IP. Topics include:

- Network architectures and physical/logical components
- Communication models such as OSI and TCP/IP
- Application Protocol: HTTP, SMTP, DNS
- Transport Layer: UDP, TCP, Performance
- IP Architecture: IPv4, NAT, Subnetting, IPv6, CIDR
- Network performance: delay, throughput, and congestion control
- Encapsulation and data flow across layers
- Applications and Examples

Illustrations and examples from the textbooks by Kurose & Ross support the explanations throughout this document. I created this material to serve as a solid foundation for anyone seeking to understand the principles of computer networking.

## 2. Communication Network Fundamentals - Vol 2

This second volume continues the study of computer networking, expanding on the foundations introduced in Volume 1. It addresses more specialized topics across different network layers:

- Data Link Layer & LAN Networks: ARP protocol, internal routing (RIP, OSPF), and routing algorithms (Distance Vector, Link State).
- Network Architecture: Evolution of the Internet, reference links, interconnection, and classification of network types.
- Software-Defined Networking (SDN): Router architecture, SDN concepts, OpenFlow protocol, P4 programming language, and Open Compute Project (OCP).
- Physical Layer: Transmission media, modulation, multiplexing, and theoretical limits (Nyquist and Shannon theorems).


## 3. MOSFET Memory Cell Programming

<small><font color="gray">The programming of a memory cell based on a MOSFET transistor consists of charging the floating gate with electrons, which occurs exclusively through Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from the conduction band of the substrate.

In the File, you will find how to carry out this process, which includes:

- Simulating the temporal evolution of the current injected into the floating gate and the threshold voltage for a control gate voltage of VG = 11V, determining the maximum achievable value of Vt.
- Analyzing the changes in the results when VG = 12V and VG = 13V.
- Exploring strategies to achieve a constant current injection process and simulating the response for VG = 11V.</font></small>

## 4. Semiconductor Device Modeling
This File contains the complete development of the technical report titled "Modeling of Semiconductor Devices: Diode, Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT), and N-Channel MOSFET" by Luciana Falcon. The project thoroughly analyzes the theoretical and practical behavior of fundamental electronic devices through simulations, analytical modeling, and comparison with real manufacturer data.

Objective:

Diode:
- I-V characteristic simulated in LTSpice and parameter extraction (Is, n) using Python.
- Analysis under forward and reverse bias using large- and small-signal models.
- Circuit modeling using small-signal equivalent (MPS) and comparison with transient simulation results.

Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT):
- Extraction of key parameters (Is, Î², VA, VCEsat) from simulated curves and datasheets.
- Biasing analysis with and without emitter resistance (RE).
- Study of collector current (IC) variation with temperature.

N-Channel MOSFET:
